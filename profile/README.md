## Welcome to Tornado-Repositories, an archival fork of the Tornado Cash source code

These repositories contain an archival fork of the Tornado Cash and Tornado Cash Nova source code base. 
They are maintained on Github by [Matthew D. Green](https://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/) of Johns Hopkins for teaching and research purposes.

### What is Tornado Cash and what is this repository?

Tornado Cash (and Tornado Nova) are open-source coin mixing tools that were developed by an independent team of software
developers and deployed onto Ethereum and several other blockchains. On August 8, 2022 the Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC), a division of the US Treasury, [declared](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916) "Tornado Cash" and "Tornado Cash Nova" to be
Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), effectively sanctioning Tornado Cash.

This move to sanction Tornado Cash is unprecedented: it is the first instance in which Treasury
has applied sanctions to an open source software project. As a result of this announcement, several cryptocurrency
organizations began to block users who had interacted with the Tornado Cash smart contract address on Ethereum. 
At the same time, Github banned the user accounts of the Tornado Cash developers, and removed the source code repositories owned by
Tornado's Github organization. 

While Github successfully removed all of the the main Tornado repositories, several recent forks of the code can be found on Github. These were recently collected together by contributors to the [tornadocash-community](https://github.com/tornadocash-community) organization. The current repository is simply a second fork of those repositories. 

### Why preserve the Tornado Cash source code?

In my role as a researcher and instructor at Johns Hopkins, I have made extensive use of the Tornado Cash and Tornado Nova source code 
to teach concepts related to cryptocurrency privacy and zero-knowledge technology. The loss or decreased availability of this 
source code will be harmful to the scientific and technical communities.

Moreover, I am uncomfortable with the implications of the Github decision. Github is a private company, and of course can suspend 
users for any perceived violation of its Terms of Service. However it is absurd to pretend that Github's decision was not triggered as 
a direct result of the OFAC/Treasury sanctions action. In my opinion the removal of source code from Github as a result of OFAC's order should have been entirely predictable. Given that much of the Internet publishing infrastructure is operated by private firms, this means that OFAC has the ability to ban speech by creating severe sanctions risk to private organizations. That "chilling effect" means that protected speech can be effectively deprived to certain organization. 

The current repository exists to make it clear to Treasury/USG that *this code has value*, and its removal has consequences to researchers and students in the United States. Moreover, it exists to test the proposition that code removal should ever been an appropriate response to sanctions orders, no matter how justifiable the order may seem. I have discussed my concerns with the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and they have agreed to represent me as a client, should legal representation become necessary. 
See their blog post here. 

### Will you take PRs for Tornado Cash, or host other projects?

These repositories are intended as an archival project only. They are yours to clone and fork. They will not be actively developed,
which means that over time they will gradually become obsolete. In the future this organization may evolve to host archival forks of other non-TC privacy projects, should I determine that they are also at risk of sanctions-based code  
removal.
