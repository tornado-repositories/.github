## Welcome to the Tornado-Repositories Github organization

These repositories contain an archival fork of the Tornado Cash and Tornado Cash Nova source code base. 
They are maintained on Github by Matthew D. Green (prof. at Johns Hopkins University) for teaching purposes,
and to make sure that the source code for useful privacy code has a safe home.

# What is Tornado Cash and what is this repository?

Tornado Cash (and Tornado Nova) are open-source coin mixing tools that were developed by an independent team of software
developers and deployed onto Ethereum and several other blockchains. On August 8, 2022 the Office of Foreign
Assets Control (OFAC), a division of the US Treasury, [declared](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916) "Tornado Cash" and "Tornado Cash Nova" to be
Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs), effectively sanctioning Tornado Cash.

This move to sanction Tornado Cash was historically unique: it represents the first instance in which Treasury
has applied sanctions to an open source software project. As a result of this announcement, several cryptocurrency
organizations began to block users who had interacted with the Tornado Cash smart contract address. Github banned
the user accounts of the Tornado developers, and removed all source code repositories related to this project.

While Github deleted the main Tornado repositories, several recent forks of the code exist on Github. These were collected
together by the [tornadocash-community](https://github.com/tornadocash-community) organization. This organization simply contains
an independent fork of the repositories that were collected by that organization.

# Why preserve the Tornado Cash source code?

In my role as a researcher and instructor at Johns Hopkins, I have made extensive use of the Tornado Cash and Tornado Nova source code 
to teach concepts related to cryptocurrency privacy and zero-knowledge technology. The loss or decreased availability of this 
source code will be harmful to the scientific and technical communities.

Moreover, I am uncomfortable with the implications of the Github decision. Github is a private company, and of course can suspend 
users for any perceived violation of its Terms of Service. However it is absurd to pretend that Github's decision was not triggered as 
a direct result of the OFAC/Treasury sanctions action. In my opinion the chain of consequence from OFAC order to source code removal is  
entirely predictable and expected. Given that much of the Internet publishing infrastructure is operated by private firms, this creates a "chilling effect" in 
which certain software projects may be effectively deprived of the ability to distribute source code. These repositories exist to test that proposition. 

I have discussed these concerns with the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and they have agreed to represent me.
